*************************
CCPP Overview
*************************

Ideas for the Common Community Physics Package (:term:`CCPP`) originated within the Earth System Prediction Capability physics interoperability group (now the `Interagency Council for Advancing Meteorological Services; ICAMS <https://www.icams-portal.gov/>`_), which has representatives from the US National Center
for Atmospheric Research (:term:`NCAR`), the Navy, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) Research Laboratories, NOAA National Weather Service, and other groups. Physics
interoperability, or the ability to run a given physics :term:`suite` in various host models,
has been a goal of this multi-agency group for several years. An initial mechanism to
run the physics of NOAAâ€™s Global Forecast System (GFS) model in other host models,
the Interoperable Physics Driver (IPD), was developed by the NOAA Environmental Modeling
Center (EMC) and later augmented by the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL).

The :term:`CCPP` expanded on that work by meeting `additional requirements put forth by NOAA <https://dtcenter.org/sites/default/files/community-code/ccpp-requirements-historical.pdf>`_, 
and brought new functionalities to the physics-dynamics interface. Those include
the ability to choose the order of parameterizations, to subcycle individual
parameterizations by running them more frequently than other parameterizations,
and to group arbitrary sets of parameterizations allowing other computations in
between them (e.g., dynamics and coupling computations). The IPD was phased out in
2021 in favor of the :term:`CCPP` as a single way to interface with physics in the :term:`UFS`

The architecture of the CCPP and its connection to a host model is shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <ccpp_arch_host>`.
Two elements of the CCPP are highlighted: a library of physical parameterizations
(:term:`CCPP Physics`) that conforms to selected standards and an infrastructure (:term:`CCPP Framework`)
that enables connecting the physics to a host model. The third element (not shown)
is the CCPP Single Column Model (SCM), a simple host model that can be used with the CCPP
Physics and Framework.

   *Architecture of the CCPP and its connection to a host model,
   represented here as the driver for an atmospheric model (yellow box). The dynamical
   core (dycore), physics, and other aspects of the model (such as coupling) are
   connected to the driving host through the pool of physics caps. The CCPP Physics is
   denoted by the gray box at the bottom of the physics, and encompasses the
   parameterizations, which are accompanied by physics caps.*

The host model needs to have functional documentation (metadata) for any variable that will be
passed to or received from the physics. The :term:`CCPP Framework` is used to compare the variables
requested by each physical :term:`parameterization` against those provided by the host model [#]_, and
to check whether they are available, otherwise an error will be issued. This process serves
to expose the variables passed between physics and dynamics, and to clarify how information
is exchanged among parameterizations. During runtime, the CCPP Framework is responsible for
communicating the necessary variables between the host model and the parameterizations.

The :term:`CCPP Physics` contains the parameterizations and suites that are used operationally in
the UFS Atmosphere, as well as parameterizations that are under development for possible
transition to operations in the future. The CCPP aims to support the broad community
while benefiting from the community. In such a CCPP ecosystem
(:numref:`Figure %s <ccpp_ecosystem>`), the CCPP can be used not only by the operational
centers to produce operational forecasts, but also by the research community to conduct
investigation and development. Innovations created and effectively tested by the research
community can be funneled back to the operational centers for further improvement of the
operational forecasts.

Both the CCPP Framework and the CCPP Physics are developed as open source code, follow
industry-standard code management practices, and are freely distributed through GitHub
(https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-physics and https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-framework).
This documentation is housed in repository https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-doc.

   *CCPP ecosystem.*

The CCPP is governed by the groups that contribute to its development. The governance
of the CCPP Physics is currently led by NOAA, and the DTC works with EMC and the
National Weather Service Office of Science and Technology Integration to determine schemes
and suites to be included and supported. The governance of the CCPP Framework is jointly
undertaken by NOAA and NCAR (see more information at https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-framework/wiki
and https://dtcenter.org/community-code/common-community-physics-package-ccpp).

The table below lists all parameterizations supported in CCPP public releases and the
`CCPP Scientific Documentation <https://dtcenter.ucar.edu/GMTB/v5.0.0/sci_doc>`_
describes the parameterizations in detail. The parameterizations
are grouped in suites, which can be classified primarily as *operational*, *developmental*, or *experimental*.
*Operational* suites are those used by operational, real-time weather prediction models. For this release, the only operational scheme is GFS_v16, which is used for `version 16 <https://www.weather.gov/media/notification/scn_21-20_gfsv16.0_aaa_update.pdf>`_ of the GFS model.
*Developmental* suites are those that are officially supported for this CCPP release with one or more host models, but are not currently used in any operational models. These may include pure scientific schemes, or "release candidate" schemes proposed for use with future operational models.
Finally, *experimental* suites are included in the `ccpp_physics` repository, but are not supported for community use. These may be used experimentally, but proceed at your own risk.

There are also variants, which are suites that vary slightly from the other ones
for some practical reason, such as to enable a suite even when certain fields are
missing from the initial conditions. Suites are supported for use with specific
host models, such as the SCM, and the versions of the UFS Weather Model used in
the UFS Medium-Range Weather (MRW) Application or the UFS Short-Range Weather (SRW)
Application.

The second row indicates which host model the suite is supported for.
The suites that are currently supported in the CCPP are listed in the third row. The
types of parameterization are denoted in the first column, where H2O represents the stratospheric water
vapor parameterization. The operational GFS_v16 suite includes the GFDL microphysics, 
the Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE)-based EDMF planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme,
scale-aware (sa) Simplified Arakawa-Schubert (SAS) deep convection,
scale-aware mass-flux (saMF) shallow convection,
Rapid Radiation Transfer Model for General Circulation Models (RRTMG) radiation,
the GFS surface layer,
the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Environmental Sciences (CIRES) unified gravity wave drag (uGWD), 
the Noah Land Surface Model (LSM),
the 2015 Navy Research Laboratory (NRL) ozone and stratospheric water vapor schemes, 
and the NSST ocean scheme. The five developmental suites are candidates for future operational implementations. 
The GFS_v17_p8 suite features several differences from the GFS_v16 suite, using 
the Thompson microphysics scheme
PBL scheme. The Chikira-Sugiyama (csawmg) suite uses the Morrison-Gettelman 3 (MG-3) microphysics
scheme and Chikira-Sugiyama convection scheme with Arakawa-Wu extension (CSAW). The NOAA Global
Systems Division (GSD) v1 suite (GSD_v1) includes Thompson microphysics, Mellor-Yamada-Nakanishi-Niino
(MYNN) PBL (MYNN-EDMF) and surface layer/shallow cloud, Grell-Freitas (GF) deep
convection schemes, and the Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) LSM. Suite RRFS_v1alpha is
targeted for the Rapid Refresh Forecast System
(RRFS) and differs from the GSD_v1 suite by not using parameterized convection and employing the
Noah-Multiparameterization (MP) LSM.

Those interested in the history of previous CCPP releases should know that the
first public release of the CCPP took place in April 2018 and included all the
parameterizations of the operational GFS v14, along with the ability to connect to the
SCM. The second public release of the CCPP took place in August 2018 and additionally
included the physics suite tested for the implementation of GFS v15. The third public release of
the CCPP, in June 2019, had four suites: GFS_v15, corresponding to the GFS v15 model implemented operationally
in June 2019, and three developmental suites considered for
use in GFS v16 (GFS_v15plus with an alternate PBL scheme, csawmg with alternate convection and
microphysics schemes, and GFS_v0 with alternate convection, microphysics, PBL, and land surface schemes).
The CCPP v4.0 release, issued in March 2020, contained suite GFS_v15p2, which is an
updated version of the operational
GFS v15 and replaced suite GFS_v15. It also contained three developmental suites:
csawmg with minor updates, GSD_v1 (an update over the previously released GSD_v0),
and GFS_v16beta, which was the target suite at the time for implementation in the
upcoming operational GFSv16 (it replaced suite GFSv15plus).
The CCPP v4.1 release, issued in October 2020, was a minor
upgrade with the capability to build the code using Python 3 (previously only Python 2
was supported).
The CCPP v5.0 release, issued in February 2021, was a major
upgrade to enable use with the UFS Short-Range Weather (SRW) Application and the RRFS_v1alpha suite.
The CCPP v6.0 release, issued in June 2022, was a major upgrade in conjunction with the release of the UFS MRW and SRW v2.0 releases.
This release introduced several new pre-operational schemes.

.. [#] As of this writing, the CCPP has been validated with two host models: the CCPP
    SCM and the atmospheric component of
    NOAAâ€™s Unified Forecast System (UFS) (hereafter the UFS Atmosphere) that utilizes
    the Finite-Volume Cubed Sphere (FV3) dynamical core.  The CCPP can be utilized both with the
    global and limited-area configurations of the UFS Atmosphere. CCPP v6.0.0 is the latest
    release compatible with the global UFS Medium-Range Weather Application and the
    limited-area UFS Short-Range Weather Application.  The CCPP
    has also been run experimentally with a Navy model. Work is under
    way to connect and validate the use of the CCPP Framework with NCAR models.
