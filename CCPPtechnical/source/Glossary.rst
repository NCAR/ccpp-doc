   CCPP
      The topic of this technical guide, the Common Community Physics Package (CCPP) is a model-agnostic, 
      well-vetted collection of codes containing atmospheric physical parameterizations
      and suites for use in NWP along with a framework that connects the physics to a :term:`host model`

   *CCPP Framework*
      The infrastructure that connects physics :term:`schemes <scheme>` with a :term:`host model`; also refers to a
      `software repository of the same name <https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-framework>`_

   *CCPP Physics*
      The pool of CCPP-compliant physics schemes; also refers to a `software repository of the same name
      <https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-framework>`_

   Fast physics
      Physical parameterizations that require tighter coupling with the dynamical core than “slow”
      physics (due to the approximated processes within the parameterization acting on a shorter 
      timescale) and that benefit from a smaller time step. The distinction is useful for greater
      accuracy, numerical stability, or both. In the UFS Atmosphere, a saturation adjustment is
      used in some suites and is called directly from the dynamical core for tighter coupling

   Group
      A set of physics :term:`schemes <scheme>` within a suite definition file (SDF) that are called together
      without intervening computations from the :term:`host application <host model>`. Groups
      are described in more detail in :numref:`Chapter %c <ConstructingSuite>`.

   Group *cap*
      Autogenerated interface between a :term:`group` of physics schemes and the :term:`host model`. Caps
      are described in more detail in :numref:`Chapter %c <SuiteGroupCaps>`.


   Host model
      A host model (or host application) is an atmospheric model or application that allocates memory, 
      provides metadata for the variables passed into
      and out of the physics, and controls time-stepping

   Interstitial scheme
      A modularized piece of code to perform data preparation, diagnostics, or other “glue”
      functions that allows primary schemes to work together as a suite. They can be categorized
      as “scheme-specific” or “suite-level”. Scheme-specific interstitial schemes augment a
      specific primary scheme (to provide additional functionality). Suite-level interstitial
      schemes provide additional functionality on top of a class of primary schemes, connect
      two or more schemes together, or provide code for conversions, initializing sums, or
      applying tendencies, for example. The details of primary vs. interstitial schemes are described in
      more detail in :numref:`Chapter %c <CompliantPhysParams>`.

   NCAR
      The National Center for Atmospheric Research - a US federally funded research and development 
      center (FFRDC) managed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) and 
      funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).

   NEMS
      The NOAA Environmental Modeling System - a software infrastructure that supports 
      NCEP/EMC’s forecast products. The coupling software is based on ESMF and the 
      `NUOPC layer <https://earthsystemmodeling.org/nuopc/>`_.

   Parameterization
      The representation, in a dynamic model, of physical effects in terms of admittedly
      oversimplified parameters, rather than realistically requiring such effects to be 
      consequences of the dynamics of the system (from the `AMS Glossary <https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Parameterization>`_)

   Phase
      A CCPP phase is one of five steps that each physics :term:`scheme` can be broken down into. Phases
      are described in more detail in :numref:`Chapter %c <CompliantPhysParams>`.

   Physics *cap*
      Generic name to refer to :term:`suite <physics suite cap>` and :term:`group physics caps <group cap>`.

   Physics Suite *cap*
      Autogenerated interface between an entire :term:`suite` of physics schemes and the :term:`host model`.
      It consists of calls to autogenerated physics group caps. It may be used to call an entire suite
      at once or to call a specific group within a physics suite

   Primary scheme
      A parameterization, such as PBL, microphysics, convection, and radiation, that fits the
      traditionally-accepted definition, as opposed to an interstitial scheme 

   Scheme
      A CCPP-compliant parameterization (:term:`primary scheme`) or auxiliary code (:term:`interstitial scheme`)

   SDF
      Suite Definition File (SDF) is an external file containing information about the 
      construction of a physics :term:`suite`. It describes the :term:`schemes <scheme>` that are called, in which
      order they are called, whether they are subcycled, and whether they are assembled
      into groups to be called together

   Set
      A collection of physics :term:`schemes <scheme>` that do not share memory (e.g. fast and slow physics)

   SCM
      The :term:`CCPP` Single Column Model (SCM) is a simple 1D :term:`host model` designed to be used with the CCPP
      Physics and Framework as a lightweight alternative to full 3D dynamical models for testing
      and development of physics :term:`schemes <scheme>` and :term:`suites <suite>`. See the `SCM User Guide <https://dtcenter.org/sites/default/files/paragraph/scm-ccpp-guide-v6-0-0.pdf>`_
      for more information.

   Slow physics
      Physical parameterizations that can tolerate looser coupling with the dynamical core
      than “fast” physics (due to the approximated processes within the parameterization
      acting on a longer timescale) and that often use a longer time step. Such parameterizations
      are typically grouped and calculated together (through a combination of process- and 
      time-splitting) in a section of an atmospheric model that is distinct from the dynamical
      core in the code organization

   Standard name
      Variable names based on CF conventions (http://cfconventions.org) that are uniquely
      identified by the *CCPP-compliant* :term:`schemes <scheme>` and provided by a :term:`host model`. See 
      :numref:`Section %s <StandardNames>` for more details.

   Subcycling
      Executing a physics :term:`scheme` more frequently (with a shorter timestep) than the rest of
      the model physics or dynamics. See :numref:`Section %s <Subcycling>` for more details.

   Suite
      A collection of :term:`primary physics schemes <primary scheme>` and :term:`interstitial schemes <interstitial scheme>` that are known to work
      well together

   UFS
      A Unified Forecast System (UFS) is a community-based, coupled comprehensive Earth
      system modeling system. The UFS numerical applications span local to global domains
      and predictive time scales from sub-hourly analyses to seasonal predictions. It is
      designed to support the Weather Enterprise and to be the source system for NOAA's
      operational numerical weather prediction applications

   UFS Atmosphere
      The atmospheric model component of the :term:`UFS`. Its fundamental parts are the dynamical
      core and the physics

   UFS Weather Model
      The combined global/regional medium- to short-range weather-prediction model used in the :term:`UFS` 
      to create forecasts
