How to Use this Document
========================

This document contains documentation for the Common Community Physics Package (CCPP). It describes the

* Physics schemes and interstitials
* Suite definition files
* CCPP-compliant parameterizations
* Process to add a new scheme or suite
* Host-side coding
* CCPP code management and governance
* Parameterization-specific output
* Debugging strategies 

The following table describes the type changes and symbols used in this guide.

.. list-table:: *Type changes and symbols used in this guide.*
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Typeface or Symbol
     - Meaning
     - Examples
   * - ``AaBbCc123``
     - 
         * The names of commands, files, and directories
         * On-screen terminal output
     - 
         * Edit your ``.bashrc`` file 
         * Use ``ls -a`` to list all files. 
         * ``host$ You have mail!``
   * - *AaBbCc123*
     - 
         * The names of CCPP-specific terms, subroutines, etc.
         * Captions for figures, tables, etc.
     - 
         * Each scheme must include at least one of the following subroutines: *_timestep_init*, *_init*, *_run*, *_finalize*, and *_timestep_finalize*.
         * *Listing 2.1: Fortran template for a CCPP-compliant scheme showing the* _run *subroutine.*
   * - **AaBbCc123**
     - Words or phrases requiring particular emphasis
     - Fortran77 code should **not** be used

Following these typefaces and conventions, shell commands, code examples, namelist variables, etc.
will be presented in this style:

.. code-block:: console

   mkdir ${TOP_DIR}

Some CCPP-specific terms will be highlighted using *italics*, and words requiring particular emphasis will be highlighted in **bold** text.

In some places there are helpful asides or warnings that the user should pay attention to; these 
will be presented in the following style:

.. note::
   This is an important point that should **not** be ignored!



In several places in the technical documentation, we need to refer to locations of files or directories in the source code. Since the directory structure depends on the host model, in particular the directories where the ``ccpp-framework`` and ``ccpp-physics`` source code is checked out, and the directory from which the ``ccpp_prebuild.py`` code generator is called, we use the following convention:

1. When describing files relative to the ``ccpp-framework`` or ``ccpp-physics`` top-level, without referring to a specific model, we use ``ccpp-framework/path/to/file/A`` and ``ccpp-physics/path/to/file/B``.
2. When describing specific tasks that depend on the directory structure within the host model, for example how to run ``ccpp_prebuild.py``, we explicitly mention the host model and use its directory structure relative to the top-level directory. For the example of the SCM: ``./ccpp/framework/path/to/file/A``.
